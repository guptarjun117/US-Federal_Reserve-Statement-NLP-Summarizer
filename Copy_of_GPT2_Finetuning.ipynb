A public assessment of the United States and its external trading partners will require a variety of factors, including a range of historical changes, economic conditions, fiscal and political conditions and the impact on foreign exchange and trade.  The Committee has taken steps to identify potential adverse changes in monetary policy.   In addition, the Committee has worked with the IMF to assess the relative risks of monetary policy to external and international financial markets.   The Committee has also conducted additional reviews of the policy environment.  The Committee believes that the Committee's recent actions have helped to develop appropriate expectations and benchmarks for monetary policy.  The Committee has considered the possibility that the Committee has adopted other measures to address the uncertainty about future monetary policy. The Committee believes that these additional efforts will enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the Committee's monetary policy program. The Committee believes that monetary policy should be able to withstand the uncertainties associated with the pandemic, but that the risk posed by the events of May and June is manageable. The Committee will continue to work with the IMF and other public and private sector stakeholders to address issues of financial inclusion, liquidity, and risk.   The Committee is evaluating the prospects for a U.S. dollar tightening to 3/4 to 4 percent for the next three years.  The Committee has not made any specific changes to monetary policy. In addition to the Committee's decisions regarding the policy environment, the Committee has evaluated the potential implications of the United States monetary policy environment on international and domestic economic activity and on macroeconomic factors and the effect of fiscal policy on monetary policy.   The Committee's decision, as described in the Plan for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet, has not been fully evaluated by the IMF. The Committee's decision, as described in the Plan for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet, has not been fully evaluated by the Committee. The Committee is currently reviewing the proposed rate of interest rates that are set for the fiscal year of 2016.  The Committee's decisions, as described in the Plan for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet, have not been fully evaluated by the Committee. The Committee is considering other policy options to mitigate fiscal policy effects.   Although the Committee has not yet adopted any of these options, it may act in the future to adjust its stance on fiscal policy.   The Committee has made this determination in consultation with the IMF, the Committee's central bank partners and other central banks as well as others who have provided critical information regarding the risks of international monetary policy and the potential effects on fiscal policy.   The Committee has already taken steps to address the risks posed by international monetary policy, including a review of policy-relevant risks and the possible role of interest rates. \n",

Job gains have been robust  in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined substantially.  Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia is c ausing tremendous human and economic hardship.  The implications for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain.  The invasion and related events are creating  additional upward pressure on inflation and are likely to weigh on economic activity.  In addition, CO VID- related lockdowns in China are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions.  The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run.  With appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, the Committee expects inflation to return to its 2  percent objective and the labor market to remain strong.  In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 3/4 to 1 percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.

            "Summarised text: : The Committee believes that a sustained low in the level of unemployment and an increase in GDP in July may reduce the risks for the U.S. economy and its ability to support the long-term growth outlook of the U.S. Federal Reserve System. However, we anticipate that the Committee will focus on fiscal policy and fiscal discipline in order to mitigate future challenges and provide an overall assessment of current and future risk factors.  The Committee is not convinced that current policies are appropriate in addressing the current challenges with regard to employment and inflation.   On an economic and budgetary basis, the Committee believes that fiscal policy needs to be focused on reducing the use of government reserves to fund programs and efforts that will reduce the cost of government services, as well as the effects on national financial stability and on economic recovery.   As a nation, we do not expect that the current level of public debt will continue to have any impact on economic activity. The Committee believes that policymakers should adopt fiscal policy in a more balanced manner to meet their economic needs and expectations for the nation's economy and the nation's security. However, the Committee believes that it is premature to assume that any policy actions will be effective.   To that end, the Committee believes that the Committee is willing to continue its effort to strengthen our national interest while maintaining fiscal policy and fiscal discipline.  Achieving full employment, as determined by the Committee, is the key priority of this Committee.  The Committee recognizes that the economic circumstances in the U.S. have been exceptionally difficult for many years. We understand that the Federal Reserve System faces a challenging economic situation. This Committee expects our economic outlook to improve substantially with time.  As of today, the Committee is in the midst of reviewing the Federal Reserve's revised financial statements and is considering what actions we could take to enhance the Committee's credibility in preparing our financial statements for our economic and economic recovery.   The Committee intends to conduct daily reviews of our consolidated financial statements to determine whether we maintain current levels of confidence and in keeping with our current positions.\n",

            "Original text: Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months but are being affected by the recent sharp rise in COVID-19 cases.  Job gains have been solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined substantially.  Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation.  Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus.  Progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply cons traints are expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation.  Risks to the economic outlook remain, including from new va riants of the virus. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run.  In s upport of these goals, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate  at 0 to 1/4 percent.  With inflation well above 2 percent and a strong labor market , the Committee expects it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate.   The Committee decided to continue to redu ce the monthly pace of its net asset purchases, bringing them to an end in early March.  Beginning in February, the Committee will increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $20 billion per month and of agency mortgage ‑backed securities by at l east $10 billion per month.  The Federal Reserve’s ongoing purchases and  holdings of securities will continue to foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of  incoming information for the economic outlook.  The Committee would be prepared to  adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emer ge that could impede the at tainment of the Committee’s goals.

If the Committee were to take any action to mitigate the risk of new influenza viruses that could result from the pandemic, we would consider an action at the rate of 2 percent per month for the period to be reached.  A number of agencies, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, are involved in the financing of the research and development effort to combat the pandemic.  The Committee and the Federal Reserve are conducting studies to evaluate the safety, effectiveness and appropriateness of new influenza virus vaccines in developing countries, such as the United States.  The Committee would also assess the advisability of the federal government buying from private equity firms and other financial institutions to minimize the costs associated with the pandemic. The Committee also would look at whether public health and financial markets in the United States are affected by the pandemic, including whether private investment and other costs may be offset by public health and public financial markets, particularly in the United States. The Committee would also consider whether new influenza viruses have the potential to affect public health or public financial markets, including whether such costs may be mitigated by the actions of existing and new public health organizations, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to mitigate risks related to the pandemic.

The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months but are being affected by the recent sharp rise in COVID-19 cases.  Job gains have been solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined substantially.  Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation.  Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus.  Progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply cons traints are expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation.  Risks to the economic outlook remain, including from new va riants of the virus. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run.  In s upport of these goals, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate  at 0 to 1/4 percent.  With inflation well above 2 percent and a strong labor market , the Committee expects it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate.   The Committee decided to continue to redu ce the monthly pace of its net asset purchases, bringing them to an end in early March.  Beginning in February, the Committee will increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $20 billion per month and of agency mortgage ‑backed securities by at l east $10 billion per month.  The Federal Reserve’s ongoing purchases and  holdings of securities will continue to foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of  incoming information for the economic outlook.  The Committee would be prepared to  adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emer ge that could impede the at tainment of the Committee’s goals.
